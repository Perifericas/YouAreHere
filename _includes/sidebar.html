<h2>"You Are Here" is an experimental journalism-distribution network.</h2>
<p>It leverages small, inexpensive, open-source wireless routers to deliver compelling, location-specific content to communities around New York. Starting with a series of high-quality audio pieces that reflect the unique culture and history of the people, politics and communities of the geographic area, the "You Are Here" servers can also act as a kind of digital town square where those nearby can exchange ideas, stories and information. The fact that these servers are not connected to the Internet allows them to accumulate a genuinely local character, in addition to serving as a safe, resilient means of exchanging digital information.<br/><br/>
This is a research project of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism, with fellows Sarah Grant, Susan McGregor, Benjamen Walker, Dan Phiffer, and Amelia Marzec.</p>
