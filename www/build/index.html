      <h2>about</h2>
      <p>“You Are Here” is an experimental journalism-distribution network that leverages small, inexpensive, open-source wireless routers to deliver compelling, location-specific content to communities around New York. Starting with a series of high-quality audio pieces that reflect the unique culture and history of the people, politics and communities of the geographic area, the “You Are Here” servers can also act as a kind of digital town square where those nearby can exchange ideas, stories and information. The fact that these servers are not connected to the Internet allows them to accumulate a genuinely local character, in addition to serving as a safe, resilient means of exchanging digital information.</p>
      <p>This is a research project of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism, with fellows Sarah Grant, Dan Phiffer, Amelia Marzec, Susan McGregor, and Benjamen Walker.</p>
